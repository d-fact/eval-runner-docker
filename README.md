# DiffBase


**DiffBase** is a toolset for extracting, storing and supporting efficient querying and
manipulation of differential facts, a uniform exchangeable representation of information extracted
from software artifacts. Differential facts can be any information about software artifacts and
especially highlight their changes and linkage between versions along the software evolution.

We implement multiple software evolution management tasks with our tools to prove its usefulness and
efficiency.

There are multiple Dockerfiles inside this repo, for replicating the evaluations in the paper and
showing the reusability of components.

#### Pre-requisites
+ Clone this repo `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/d-fact/eval-runner-docker diffbase`
+ Docker (tested with version 20.10.5, recent version should also work)
  - Official Docker Installation Guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 
+ docker-compose (tested with version 1.25.0)
  - Installation Guide at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


## Scripts for Quick Start
We provide quick scripts for building and running dockers, you can use `quick-slicing.sh` and `quick-rts.sh`.

You can also check the following section for detailed step-by-step explanations.

## Evaluation Replication
Assuming `docker` and `docker-compose` is installed properly and current working directory is at the
root path of the cloned repo, we can run the following command to build the image for evaluation.

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build 
```

If successfully built, there would be two images built --- *diffbase_slicing-driver* and
*diffbase_rts-driver*. (They should be shown in the image list if issuing `docker image ls` on
cmdline, and their names are usually prefixed by the folder name. So you did not clone the repo as
`diffbase`, the image names can be different.)

```sh
% docker image ls
REPOSITORY                 TAG      IMAGE ID
diffbase_rts-driver        latest   <some hash>
diffbase_slicing-driver    latest   <some hash>
```

### Evaluate Semantic Hisotry Slicing (Sec. 4.2)
```sh
docker-compose up slicing-driver
```

This takes about three minutes (on my machine with Xeon(R) E5-1650 v3, 16GB RAM and HDD).

#### Inspect results in data volume
Outputs and intermediate data are in the data volume created during `docker-compose up
slicing-driver`.

Mountpoint of the volume can be checked using `docker volume inspect diffbase_datavol`. (If there is
no such data volume, you can check the correct name of the data volume using `docker volume ls`.) 
The path is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/diffbase_datavol/_data` on my system.

The data volume contains following subdirs.
```
% tree -L 1 /var/lib/docker/volumes/diffbase_datavol/_data
.
â”œâ”€â”€ defects4j
â”œâ”€â”€ grok-scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ json
â”œâ”€â”€ resources
â”œâ”€â”€ rts-configs
â”œâ”€â”€ rts-repos
â””â”€â”€ slicing-results
```

After `docker-compose up` finished and exited, following directories (under data volume) should
contain output.

#### Generated Facts
`resources/file-level/output/facts` is the directory for facts generated.
E.g., in `resources/file-level/output/facts/CSV##b230a6f5##7310e5c6` there are following files.
```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ 20-deps.ta
â”œâ”€â”€ 25-inherit.ta
â”œâ”€â”€ 30-diff_tuple.ta
â”œâ”€â”€ 40-diff_attr.ta
â”œâ”€â”€ 50-hunkdep.ta
â””â”€â”€ 90-test_classes.ta
```

E.g.`20-deps.ta` contains static dependencies, such as the following snippet. It contains following information:
+ the method `next()` calls `getNextRecord()` in the first anonymous inner class of `CSVParser`;
+ `next()` is a method;
+ `Token` is a class;
+ `Constants.TAB` is a field.

```
call "org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser.1.next()" "org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser.1.getNextRecord()"
CGNodeType Method "org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser.1.next()"
CGNodeType Class "org.apache.commons.csv.Token"
CGNodeType Field "org.apache.commons.csv.Constants.TAB"
```

#### Slicing Results
`grok_run/grok_results` is the directory for slicing results. 
They should be same with results in `data/slicing-results` in this repo. 

E.g., `_data/grok_run/grok_results/` should contain the same set of commits with file `data/slicing-results/CSV-159--b230a6f5-7310e5c6.all`


#### Run Full Evaluation
To save time, we only run one group of subjects in the slicing evaluation. If you want to replicate
the evaluation on all subjects, please uncomment the command in `docker-compose.yml` and comment out the current one as shown below.

```yml
command: bash -c "
  python3 -m hislicing.main --prepare /data/json/name_eval.json -l info
  && python3 -m hislicing.main --fact /data/json/group_eval.json -l info
  && python3 -m run_grok -p /data/resources/file-level/output/facts -g /data/json/group_eval.json -s /data/grok-scripts/slice_ver.ql -o slice.out -l info
  "
# command: bash -c "
# 	python3 -m hislicing.main --prepare /data/json/name_one.json -l info
# 	&& python3 -m hislicing.main --fact /data/json/group_one.json -l info
# 	&& python3 -m run_grok -p /data/resources/file-level/output/facts -g /data/json/group_one.json -s /data/grok-scripts/slice_ver.ql -o slice.out -l info
# 	"
```
	
	
### Evaluate Regression Test Selection (Sec. 4.3)
```sh
docker-compose up rts-driver
```

The following are expected output:
```
Recreating facts-rts ... done

facts-rts exited with code 0
```

The last JSON is the percentage of testing methods selected by each tool.
They are the same in the example output since we only run one subject here.

To run all examples, remove all `--debug` in the following command in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```
command: bash -c "
  tar xf /data/defects4j/rts-repos.tar.xz -C /data/defects4j/project_repos
  && python3 -m rts.main --debug -l info --alt-config rts/config/docker.cfg -f --ensure-all-change-types
  && python3 -m rts.main --debug -l INFO --alt-config rts/config/docker.cfg -s /data/grok-scripts/rts5-imprecise.ql
  && python3 -m rts.main --debug -l INFO --alt-config rts/config/docker.cfg -v --count-method-json /data/rts-exp/results.json
  && python3 -m rts.main --debug -l INFO --alt-config rts/config/docker.cfg --percent /data/rts-exp/results.json
  "
```

#### Inspect selection results
Similar to the history slicing evaluation above, facts and results reside in the data volume after
the execution finishes.

Generated facts reside in `_data/run_grok/facts` and look similar to facts generated in the slicing evaluation above.

The selected test classes are shown under `_data/run_grok/grok_results/`. 
E.g., if run with `--debug` option, there would be file `Lang-28.affected` with following contents.

```
org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtilsTest
org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaperTest
```

## Reusing Components
Besides the replication of evaluation in the paper, all the components in the artifacts can be
reused independently. This section will go through the details of usages of each components.

This section is prepared for who want to use tools on their projects with customized scripts thus
require more things installed such as build tools for their projects (e.g., Maven and JDK) to go
through the steps.

### Java Facts Extractor


There is a `Dockerfile` inside `gitslice` sub-directory.
```sh
cd gitslice && docker build . -t java-ext-standalone
docker run -it --rm -v /path/on/the/host:/data java-ext-standalone -c /data/project.properties -e fact -exp dep diff hunk
```

Replace `/path/on/the/host` with the directory where a `project.properties` and a repo exist.

For example, you could clone `commons-csv` by `git clone https://github.com/apache/commons-csv` and put it at `/tmp/diffbase`. 
And put following configuration files at `/tmp/diffbase/csv.properties`.

```ini
# repo path
repoPath = /data/commons-csv/.git
# path to generated bytecode
classRoot = /data/commons-csv/target/classes
# older commit
startCommit = b230a6f5
# newer commit
endCommit = 7310e5c6
```

Then build commons-csv by `cd /tmp/diffbase/commons-csv && mvn test-compile` and run the following command:
```sh
docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/diffbase:/data java-ext-standalone -c "/data/csv.properties" -e fact -exp dep diff hunk
```
There will be a `.facts` directory containing generated facts, similar to the that in the evluation above.
Users can choose between `-e fact` and `-e dl` for different fact formats and `-exp dep diff hunk` for invoking different extractors.

```
usage:
-c,--config <arg>         Path to project configuration file.
-e,--engine <arg>         Select slicing engine: [dl|fact].
-ext,--extractors <arg>   Choose extractors: [dep|diff|hunk|cov]
```

### History Facts Extractor
Check [ext-gitfacts](ext-gitfacts) for details. Note that we have not provided a docker for this
extractor and user need rust/cargo toolchains to use it.
